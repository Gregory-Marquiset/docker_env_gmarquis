# Docker Development Environment for Interactive Web Application

This repository provides a Dockerized development environment designed for building a responsive and interactive web application. Equipped with modern tools and libraries like Node.js, React, Three.js, and NeoVim, this setup is tailored for developing applications with rich UIs and 3D graphics.

## üõ† Key Features

- **React and Shadcn UI**: for building modular and responsive UI components.
- **Three.js**: integration for immersive 3D graphics and animations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: for efficient and customizable styling across the application.
- **Express.js**: for managing server-side routing and backend API handling.
- **NeoVim**: with autocompletion, Git integration, and code folding for an optimized coding experience.
- **Automated Testing**: with Jest for unit and integration tests.
- **ESLint and Prettier**: for maintaining code quality and consistent formatting.
- **CI/CD-ready**: Docker setup that supports scalable development and deployment workflows.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** must be installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-development-env.git
   cd docker-development-env

2. **Run Docker with the update script**:

    This command will ensure your Docker container is up-to-date and starts the development environment.
    ```bash
    ./docker-update.sh

## üìÑ Useful Commands
- **Enter the container**:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it your_service_name /bin/bash
- **Use NeoVim in the container**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose run neovim
- **Run tests**:

    Inside the Docker container, execute:
    ```bash
    npm test
- **Lint and format code**:

    To check and format code with ESLint and Prettier:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    npm run format
